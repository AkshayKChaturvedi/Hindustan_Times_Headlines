    "* One might notice that I have not written a general function through which a URL can be passed and headlines from a news website can be extracted, the reason is that different news websites have different html structure (not much is common between these webpages) thereby making it rather difficult to write a general function for different news websites. I looked at webpages of Hindustan Times, Times of India, BBC and CNN, html structure was very different for all of them. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong."
